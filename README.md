Python Robust PCA
=================

pyrpca contains Python implmentations of Robust PCA for medical imaging and
computer vision applications, featuring a low-rank atlas building technique
applied to traumatic brain injury(TBI) MRI images.

Subdirectory content:
core --- two implementations of RPCA
examples -- a couple of ipython notebook examples of running RPCA
tests -- testing scripts of the core functionalities
low_rank_atlas -- the study of using  RPCA in a low-rank atlas building framework
eval_utils -- the utilitiy scripts to evaluate the results on the low rank atlas building framework

pyrpca implements two recent proposals for *robust PCA*:
```bibtex
@article{Candes11a,
    author = {E.J.~Cand\'es and X.~Li and Y.~Ma and J.~Wright},
    title = {Robust Principal Component Analysis?},
    year = 2011,
    volume = 58,
    number = 3,
    journal = {J. ACM},
    pages = {1-37}}
```
and
```bibtex
@article{Xu12a,
    author = {H.~Xu and C.~Caramanis and S.~Sanghavi},
    title = {Robust {PCA} via Outlier Pursuit},
    journal = {IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory},
    volume = 59,
    number = 5,
    pages = {3047-3064},
    year = 2012}
```
Please cite these articles in case you use this code. Note that the original
authors of those articles also provide MATLAB code. Further, the objectives
of the two works are different: Candes et al.'s approach assumes randomly
distributed corruptions throughout the dataset, while Xu et al.'s approach
assumes that full observations (i.e., column vectors of the data matrix) and
not just single entries are corrupted.

Requirements
------------

* [**numpy**](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [**SimpleITK**](http://www.simpleitk.org) [Optional]

Problem Statement(s)
--------------------

See references (above) for the exact problem formulations of Candes
et al. and Xu et al.

Example
-------

An illustrative example for Candes et al.'s RPCA approach is to use a
checkerboard image (provided under the `examples` directory) which is,
by definition, low-rank and corrupt that image with randomly distributed
outliers. The task is then to recover the low-rank part and thus obtain
a *clean* version of the checkerboard image (as well as the sparsity
pattern).

The `examples` directory contains an example (`ex1.py`) that demonstrates
exactly this scenario.  (**Note:** The example requires
[SimpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org)'s python wrapping for image loading and
image writing; it should be easy to replace these parts with your favorite
image handling library, though).

Run the code with
```bash
python ex1.py checkerboard.png 0.3 /tmp/outlierImage.png /tmp/lowRank.png
```
Two images will be written: `/tmp/outlierImage.png` (i.e., the image *with*
outliers) and `/tmp/lowRank.png` (i.e., the *low-rank* recovered part).

Using the IPython Notebook
--------------------------

We provide an IPython notebook, ```pyrpca-Tutorial.ipynb``` which can be found
in the top-level directory of ```pyrpca```. It basically walks a new user through
the example implemented in ```ex1.py```.

The following instructions were tested on a Linux machine running
Ubuntu 12.04. We assume that you have ```virtualenv``` installed,
e.g., using ```apt-get install python-virtualenv```. Basically, we
create a virtual environment, install all the required packages
and eventually run the IPython notebook.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir tutorial-env
virtualenv ~/tutorial-env --no-site-packages
~/tutorial-env/bin/pip install ipython
~/tutorial-env/bin/pip install ipython[zmq]
~/tutorial-env/bin/pip install tornado
~/tutorial-env/bin/pip install numpy
~/tutorial-env/bin/pip install matplotlib
~/tutorial-env/bin/easy_install SimpleITK
```
Next, launch the IPython notebook:
```bash
~/tutorial-env/bin/ipython notebook --pylab=inline
```
